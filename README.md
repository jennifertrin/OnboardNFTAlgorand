# Overview
**Where are the ALGO NFTs?** is a marketing strategy to super connect the entire web3 community to Algorand using NFTs. Algorand users will uncover the most exciting, beautiful NFTs with the most utility created by the best artists in the space while also using the best dapps in the Algorand space. 

With less NFT adoption compared to other chains, the Algorand NFT ecosystem is in need of promotion that sparks greater engagement. As of January 2023, Algorand had 16.84 million active wallets but only 14,650 wallets have bought NFTs and 8,1653 wallets have created NFTs.. More than two million NFTs are minted on Algorand, generating a total of  437,132 individual sales worth 49 million ALGO (at a $0.25 USD per ALGO price, worth $12 million USD)  [1]. Despite the significant numbers, similar-sized or even smaller chains are experiencing greater NFT adoption. Binance Smart Chain has a similar amount of active wallets at 16.9 active wallets but has 71x more NFTs minted (total of 142 million) and 27x NFT market cap (1.07 million BNB or $331 million) [2]. Cronos Chain (formerly Crypto.com) also has around two million NFTs minted but with only 113 thousand active wallets and a higher market cap at 314 million CRO or $25 million USD [3]. 

This marketing strategy envisions the current “super user” artists and collectors and “super” dapps to super fuel the adoption and engagement of Algorand NFTs. 

# Goals
- Increase the percentage of Algorand active wallets with NFTs by 50 percent
- Increase the number of NFTs created on the Algorand chain by 50 percent
- Increase the number of active users on other chains who create Algorand wallets and use the Alogrand blockchain for the first time
- Forge partnerships between Algorand Foundation and dapps supporting Algorand in the key areas:
    - Wallet
    - Data analytics
    - On-chain wallet-to-wallet chat
    - NFT claims / airdrop
    - NFT marketplace
- Increase usage of partner dapps by ten percent during the promotional periods

## Campaigns

### Phase 1: Artist Engagement

#### Activity 1: Provide Top-Tier Education on NFTs. Make Algorand the Harvard for NFTs.

**Examples**:

**Exclusive NFT Bootcamps**

In the music industry, top songwriters attend week-long camps sponsored by top record labels to compose songs for top singers.. Top NFT artists from the Algorand and other blockchain ecosystems are invited to attend virtual and/or in-real life camps to learn more about the Algorand blockchain and create promotional NFTs for a major Algorand airdrop.

**Selection Process**
The Algorand Foundation will invite the top 5% of all artists each six months on partner NFT marketplaces such as AlgoxNFT and Rand Gallery to automatically attend the bootcamps. The Algorand Foundation can have their users of the partner NFT marketplaces to vote on the selection criteria on the Algorand Governance Platform. This creates friendly competition from the existing Algorand artists to curate high-quality work and provides an additional engagement mechanism separate from buying NFTs for NFT collectors. 

NFT artists from other blockchains can apply to the bootcamps using an application process hosted on the Algorand Foundation website. Enabling artists from different ecosystems to attend will boost the credibility of Algorand artists and assure the value of using the Algorand chain.

**Bootcamp Example Structure**
- Invite the top 250 or more NFTs artists in Algorand to attend. Open an application call for an additional 250 or more artists in other ecosystems.
- Virtual bootcamps are hosted on Zoom and Discord. In-person bootcamps are hosted in conjunction with a major Algorand event such as Decipher. 
- Select session topics:
   - What is Algorand?
   - What are the types of NFTs on Algorand? How to mint an NFT on Algorand.
   - Success stories on selling NFTs on Algorand
   - Building NFT communities on Algorand
   - NFT Utility Tools
   - Why launch a token vs. an NFT?
- After each bootcamp, Algorand-selected judges will pick between 20-50 pieces of art as finalists. The selected finalist pieces will be used for the promotional NFT airdrops to Algorand and partner marketplace users and are selected for collection funding by partner venture capitalists. 

**NFT Hackathons**

Since most hackathons are focused on developers, upcoming artists do not have a community-based way to curate and earn recognition. Algorand Foundation can host in no-code hackathons solely intended for the ideating, creation, and minting of Alogrand NFTs. 

**Examples of Prize Categories**
- Best NFT PFP Collection Idea
- Most Creative Use of Ecosystem NFT Tools
- Best Gaming Collection
- Best NFT Membership
- Best Physical Goods Representation
- Digital Art, 3D Art, and Hand-drawn
- People’s Choice Awards

Prizes include flagship Algorand NFTs, NFT memberships to Algorand DAOs, and ALGO. 

#### Activity 2: Recognize Top-Tier Artists, Collections, and Whales

**Examples:**
- Monthly, quarterly, and yearly spotlights on top artists or NFT collections posted on Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok, and Instagram. 
- Monthly, quarterly, and yearly spotlights on top NFT “whales” or collectors posted on Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok, and Instagram. Partner with an Algorand notifications application to encourage users to sign up for notifications on the top NFT collectors’ wallet activity. 
- Yearly virtual NFT Awards Show where Algorand users can nominate their favorite in each category. Example categories include:
    - Best NFT Community
    - Best Newly Launched NFT Collection
    - NFT Collection with most utility

### Phase 2: App Partnerships

#### Activity 3: Algorand DApp Partnerships

The Algorand Foundation will airdrop the bootcamp-curated NFTs to new and existing users of partner dapps who do a specific NFT-related task. Promotions of high-quality dapps built on Algorand will showcase how exciting and easy-to-use the Algorand chain is. 

**Examples**
- Users of Algorand wallet-to-wallet chat who chat with the artists from the bootcamps will receive an airdrop of an NFT from a bootcamp or hackathon-curated NFT
    - Potential partners: [Alty](https://www.algorand.com/resources/ecosystem-announcements/alty-migrates-to-algorand-enabling-instant-chat-based-crypto-transactions/), chats on other chains but might be open to integrating with Algorand ([Dialect](https://www.dialect.to/), , [Push Protocol](https://push.org/), [XMTP](https://xmtp.org/), [Notifi.Network](https://notifi.network/))
- Users of an Algorand analytics application or indexer who create queries about NFTs during the promotional period will receive an airdrop of a bootcamp or hackathon-curated NFT
    - Potential Partners: [Flipside Crypto](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/), [Algorand Foundation (using their indexer)](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/indexer/)
- X percent of users can claim an Algorand NFT on an Algorand whitelist NFT site during a promotional period
    - Potential Partners: [Ulam Labs](https://www.ulam.io/case-studies/opennft-whitelabel-nft-marketplace), [Abris.io](https://abris.io/), [DEPT](https://www.deptagency.com/), [Algomart](https://algomart.dev/)

- Users with airdropped Algorand NFTs can swap or trade their NFT for more or different Algorand NFTs 
    - Potential partners: [Tinyman](https://tinyman.org/)

#### Activity 4: DApp Partnerships on other Chains

Bringing awareness of Algorand NFTs to NFT enthusiasts and crypto natives on other chains can accelerate Algorand NFT adoption, as opposed to marketing to existing Algorand users who are already less interested in NFTs. 

**Examples**
- Users on other chains of wallets that support Algorand will receive an in-wallet notification about the Algorand blockchain and airdrop of an Algorand NFT.
    - Potential Partners: [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/)
- Users who chat with any non-Algorand wallet about Algorand on a wallet-to-wallet blockchain will receive an NFT airdrop. The non-Algorand wallet will receive a claim link to receive an Algorand NFT sent their email address or chat
    - Potential Partners: [Dialect](https://www.dialect.to/), [Push Protocol](https://push.org/), [XMTP](https://xmtp.org/), [Notifi.Network](https://notifi.network/)
- Users can collect an Algorand gaming collectible in a blockchain application
    - Potential Partners: [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), [Splinterlands](https://splinterlands.com/), [Star Atlas](https://staratlas.com/)

# Where are the ALGO NFTs?

Where are the ALGO NFTs? is a marketing campaign to super connect the entire web3 community to Algo using NFTs. Algo users will go on a hunt for each other and whales of other blockchains to uncover the most exciting, beautiful NFTs with the most utility created by the best artists in the space. Through the hunt and gather adventure, participants will use the best dapps on ALGO.

## Goals
- Increase the percentage of Algorand active wallets with NFTs
- Increase the number of active users on other chains who create Algorand wallets and use the Alogrand blockchain for the first time
- Generate awareness on key dapps that support Alogrand in the key areas:
   - Wallet
   - Data analytics
   - On-chain chat
   - NFT claims / airdrop
   - NFT marketplace
   
 ## The concept
Users of Alogrand wallets will need to find other users who own each NFT in a predefined combination of primarily Algorand NFTs and 1-2 NFTs on other chains. Any group of Algo users and users on other chains who can confirm that they own the predfined combination will win prizes. 

Create NFTs to airdrop

Partner with top ALGO products to airdrop these NFTs to all of the users + an additional 50,000 other active ALGO wallets

Prepare several dozen of predfined combinations for the hunt and gather.
